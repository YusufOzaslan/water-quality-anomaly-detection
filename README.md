# water-quality-anomaly-detection
Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm to detect water anomalies for water quality test process.

The following algoritms have been tested for the anomaly detection. They have been ranked from best anomaly finding results to the 
worst: 

1. Isolation Forest
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Local Outliner Factor
