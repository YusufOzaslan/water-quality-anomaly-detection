## Water Quality Anomaly Detection

Implementation of Machine Learning Algorithm to detect water anomalies for water quality test process.

### Background:

Anomaly detection is a very specific branch of machine learning, the algortihms presented here were implemented for internship in Center SAU. OPC data was taken to local computer
using a C# code.

### Dataset:

Dataset for the values could not have been found on Kaggle or other sources. Due to the sensors not being setup custom dataset was coded which can be found in the data folder.

### Algorithms:

The following algorithms have been tested for the anomaly detection. They have been ranked from best anomaly finding results to the worst:

<ul>
    <li>Isolation Forest</li>
    <li>Random Forest</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Local Outliner Factor</li>
</ul>
